How to setup to postgres for irrexplorer and load data into it.

Later this will be nicer process, for now the focus is on minimal amount of
code, and getting something to work.


### Fetching database

./fetch irr.yml

Create file with SQL insert statements:

zcat *.db*.gz | ./create_inserts > irr.sql

And the ripe managed space

cat ../data/ripe-managed-space.txt |./create_ripe_managed  > ripe_managed.sql


### Loading database

As postgres user

# createdb irrexplorer

As irrexplorer user

# psql irrexploer

=> \i ../data/schema.sql
=> \i ripe_managed.sql
=> \i irr.sql
